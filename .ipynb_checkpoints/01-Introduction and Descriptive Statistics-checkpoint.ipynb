    "Malcolm Forbes, who once got lost floating for miles in one of his famous balloons and finally landed in the middle of a cornfield. He spotted a man coming toward him and asked, “Sir, can you tell me where I am?” The man said, “Certainly, you are in a basket in a field of corn.” Forbes said, “You must be a statistician.” The man said, “That’s amazing, how did you know that?” “Easy,” said Forbes, “your information is concise, precise, and absolutely useless!”"

    "- The word statistics is derived from the Italian word stato, which means “state,” and statista refers to a person involved with the affairs of state. Therefore, statistics originally meant the collection of facts useful to the statista. Statistics in this sense was used \n",
    "- Statistics is a science—the science of information. Information may be qualitative or quantitativein 16th-century Italy and then spread to France, Holland, and Germany"
